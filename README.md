# Free Summer Lunch Map

This project shows a map of locations in Alachua County, Florida where free summer meals are available for students. The data comes from a public Google Sheet maintained by the school district.

## About the Program

Each summer the Alachua County Public Schools provide free breakfast and lunch to children 18 years and younger. Sites are set up at schools, libraries and community centers across the county. Most operate on weekdays during the summer break. The program is open to all children and no registration is required.

## About the Map

The interactive map offers a quick way to find a nearby meal site. Each marker represents a location from the spreadsheet. When available, the markers indicate if a site is currently serving meals. Click a marker to see the address, serving dates and times, and a link for driving directions.

If latitude and longitude aren't provided in the spreadsheet, the application geocodes each address using the public Nominatim service from OpenStreetMap. Results are cached locally in your browser to avoid unnecessary lookups.
