## About the Program

Each summer the Alachua County Public Schools provide free breakfast and lunch to children 18 years and younger. Sites are set up at schools, libraries and community centers across the county. Most operate on weekdays during the summer break. The program is open to all children and no registration is required.

## About the Map

The interactive map offers a quick way to find a nearby meal site. Each marker represents a location from the dataset. When available, the markers indicate if a site is currently serving meals. Click a marker to see the address, serving dates and times, and a link for driving directions.

All locations now include latitude and longitude in the CSV. This avoids slow geocoding lookups when the map loads.
